Website was made for the purpose of completing the course at the University in 2020.  
I created a new wordpress template from scratch mainly using php and wordpress functions.   
To speed up the creation of such a website, many free content management plugins were installed.  
The website logo was created in the GIMP program, while the photos used were taken from pixabay.  
The template includes, among others: home page, about us page, gallery, registration and login page.
